Last week, during the Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) conference, I presented the current progress of the SESAM project.

The Research Track at ESEM provides an excellent platform to showcase ongoing national and international projects that are of interest to the software engineering community. It also offers valuable opportunities to receive feedback, exchange ideas, and foster new research collaborations.

The SESAM project was well received, particularly for its ambition to integrate multiple data sources to support developers in performing more secure software development activities. Several attendees expressed interest in the projectâ€™s methodological approach and its potential practical impact for the industry partners involved.

Moreover, we engaged in productive discussions with fellow researchers focusing on software supply chain security and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). These exchanges opened possibilities for future collaboration and alignment with related research initiatives in the area of secure and transparent software ecosystems.
