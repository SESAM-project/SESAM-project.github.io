[CodeScene](https://codescene.com) is a multi-purpose software engineering intelligence platform bridging code, business, and people.
The primary CodeScene use case is to highlight social patterns in software development projects followed by actionable recommendations for technical debt management. 
CodeScene AB was founded in 2015, and as of 2024, it has customers in  more than 30 countries, with the main markets being the US and Europe. 
CodeScene mission is to guide organizations toward a healthy codebase where developers can spend more time on innovation while reducing stress and business risk in the process.

CodeScene tools currently facilitate core development tasks and software quality activities, such as code reviews, test case prioritization, and technical debt management.
SESAM aims to integrate with CodeScene's existing products, thereby broadening their capability spectrum to include secure software development practices. 
Such integration is a first exploration towards expanding CodeScene offerings in secure software development, which customers increasingly request.
Sensible automation decision-making provides valuable insights for a company like CodeScene, which builds and commercializes automation tools. 
The knowledge gained from developing the projects' framework has the potential to refine the decision-making algorithms within the existing CodeScene tools.
The collaboration with other software development companies within the project is also expected to showcase CodeScene products in new domains (e.g., fintech) and possibly start new partnerships. 

CodeScene participates in the joint development of the project. Through their platform, CodeScene provides the means to collect, filter, and visualize artifacts (e.g., technical debt items) that contain security-relevant information. 
CodeScene will provide licenses and training for their toolset, and support the co-production of the envisioned framework through their know-how in tool development and automation.
CodeScene will conduct feasibility and small-scale studies with their development teams.
