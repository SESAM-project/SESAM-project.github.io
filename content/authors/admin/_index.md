I'm interested in various aspects of software and requirements engineering, such as:

- data-driven requirements engineering,
- developers' affect, behaviours, and cognition,
- software testing, including security testing.

My work focuses on empirical methodologies. I have strong expertise in:

- designing, executing, and analyzing controlled experiments to evaluate software development processes and tools,
- applying machine learning and natural language processing to software development artifacts.

I am currently the principal investigator of Secure software engineering through Sensible AutoMation project (SESAM) founded by the Knowledge Foundation of Sweden (KKS) and co-PI of the project Threat Modeling for LLM-Integrated applications (ThreMoLIA) funded by the Sweden Innovation Agency (Vinnova).

At BTH, I am also involved in the Software Engineering Rethought Profile funded by KKS.
Between 2017 and 2020, I was part of the H2020 project OpenReq funded by the European Union.
During my Ph.D., I participated in the project Empirical Assessment of Test-Driven Development (EATDD) funded by the Academy of Finland.

 I'm enthusiastic about open research data and open science.
